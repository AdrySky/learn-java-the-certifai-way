**Java Runtime Environment (JVM)**
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine which provides a portable execution environment for Java-based applications.  

There are two variations of Java Installation
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

**Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**
- Software bundle that allows Java Programs to run 
- Does not provide development environment. 

**Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- The full-featured SDK for Java
- **JDK includes JRE**, but also the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). Hence capable of creating and compiling programs.

Note:  
The JRE is smaller than the JDK with the lack of development tools as it require less disk spaces.
