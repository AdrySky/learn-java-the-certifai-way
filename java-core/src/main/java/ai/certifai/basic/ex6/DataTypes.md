- "Nasi Lemak!" as String
- 20 as int
- 100.054 as double
- true as boolean

Fill in after [line 34](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/java-fundamentals/blob/master/java-core/src/main/java/ai/certifai/basic/ex6/DataTypes.java#L34)

**Sample Input**  

```
int value = 2;      
eval.evaluatePerLine(value);
```

**Sample Output**

**Key Takeaways**

- Different primitive data types in Java: 
    - int
    - double
    - String
    - boolean  
    
- There's wrapper for all these primitive data types.    
  On a general note: these wrapper class wrap a primitive type into an object.    
  Subsequently, providing more flexibility in storing and manipulating the data.  
    
| Primitive Data Type | Object |
| --- | ----------- |
| int | Integer |
| double | Double |
| float | Float |
| boolean  | Boolean |
