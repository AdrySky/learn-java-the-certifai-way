| Access Modifiers | Function |
| --- | ----------- |
| public | Visible to everywhere. The method / variable can be called from anywhere from outside the program as well. |
| protected | The member can only be accessed by its own class, and subclass of its class in its own package  |
| private | The member can only be accessed by own class |
